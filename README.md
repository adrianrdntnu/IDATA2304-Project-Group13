## Abstract
Creating an application that gets temperature inputs from a greenhouse, visualizes the data on a graph/timeline, and gives a response in case the temperature deviates to a harmful value for the plants in the greenhouse. 

The application is intened to be used by an administrator over the greenhouse and monitor its values without having to be present at the greenhouse.

## Introduction
Here you introduce your project in more detail.

## Theory and technology
### 1. MQTT broker
- Stuff about MQTT broker

### 2. JavaFX
- Stuff about JavaFX features used

### 3. TCP? idk if we use this

## Approach
### 1. GitHub
- (this)

### 2. Maven
- Stuff about maven / file structure

### 3. Google checkstyle
- Why google checkstyle was chosen

### 3. Storing as a BST
- Stuff about BST, realising it probably wasn't necessary

## Additional Features
### 1. JavaFx Interface
Provides the user with an interface resembling an administrative application. The user can start and stop a temperature sensor, while getting *live** values vizualised on a linechart.

*The live values are generated by a fake value generator providing "realistic" values immitating the given sensor.

### 2. Fake Value Generator
- Stuff about how the generator works

## Methodology

## Results
The final product is a JavaFX application mimicing an administrative program used to administrate a Greenhouse and its sensors.

Because the program uses fake sensors, it both sends and retreives data from an MQTT broker.

## Conclusion and future work
