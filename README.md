## General idea:
Creating an application that gets temperature inputs from a greenhouse, visualizes the data on a graph/timeline, and gives a response in case the temperature deviates to a harmful value for the plants in the greenhouse.

## Methods used:
### 1. MQTT broker
- Stuff about MQTT broker

### 2. JavaFX
- Stuff about JavaFX features used

### 3. TCP? idk if we use this

## Approach:
### 1. GitHub
- (this)

### 2. Maven
- Stuff about maven / file structure

## Additional Features:
### 1. JavaFx Interface
Provides the user with an interface resembling an administrative application. The user can start and stop a temperature sensor, while getting *live** values vizualised on a linechart.

*The live values are generated by a fake value generator providing "realistic" values immitating the given sensor.

### 2. Fake Value Generator
- Stuff about how the generator works

## Final Product:
The final product is a JavaFX application mimicing an administrative program used to administrate a Greenhouse and its sensors.

Because the program uses fake sensors, it both sends and retreives data from an MQTT broker.

## Future Development:
- Future ideas
